# ResumeFiler
Build an agent system to assist us in filling out resumes on job-seeking websites, automatically retrieve the provided data, and persistently memorize the information that has been filled in or inquired about. Achieve "collect once, fill everywhere", break free from the time-consuming and labor-intensive cycle of repeatedly filling in resume information, and improve job-hunting efficiency.

## Module
### Automation
The automation module primarily supports browser-based automation for resume filling, including form reading, form filling, and the detection of potentially hidden fields within forms.
